          <h2>API Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            Our API provides access to Lego set data, supporting operations like
            retrieving, searching, and managing records in user collections. The
            API adheres to REST principles and is fully documented in Postman.
            You can access the documentation through the link provided in our
            README file.
